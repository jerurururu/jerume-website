		<p>I have many dreams, but I will only mention a few for now. I want to become a Civil Engineer because I've wanted that since I was a child. If Civil Engineering doesn't work out, I want to pursue Computer Engineering and IT because I love technology. I chose IT and CE because the salary is high; as time goes on, people will be primarily using technology, and because of that, jobs related to technology will see an increase in pay. Another one of my dreams is to make my parents and siblings proud of me someday. I want to build a house abroad and create a happy family.</p>
