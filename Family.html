		<p class="scale-in-ver-bottom">I am Jerume, the youngest in our family, and I am the cutest among them. I have three siblings, so there are four of us. I am the only one still studying, and all of them have already graduated from UDM. We have an IT professional, a police officer, a businessman, and me, simply the handsome one of the family. Our family wouldn't be complete without our parents. There are Papa Renato and Mama Myra; they are hardworking and kind. We are thankful to them because they sent us to school and never neglected us. Without them, we wouldn't be here, so thank you very much, Mama and Papa.</p>
